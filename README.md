# Freezer Management Card

A simplified custom Home Assistant card for tracking freezer contents with **compartment-only grouping**.

## Credit

This project is based on the original **Freezer Management** card by **Ronald Dehuysser** (`rdehuyss`), first shared on the Home Assistant Community forum and published on GitHub. This rewrite keeps the core idea while removing the original multi-step overlay and the old container/pot layer entirely.

## What this version changes

- Removes the original add overlay and uses a single inline form.
- Removes the old `pot` / container number layer from the UI and the new write model.
- Uses the modern `notify.send_message` action pattern against a `notify` entity instead of calling legacy-style notify services directly.
- Adds configurable table headers for contents, compartment, and date.
- Adds `getConfigElement()` and `getStubConfig()` so the card can be configured in the dashboard editor.
- Ships as a HACS-ready Dashboard/plugin repository with a release workflow and HACS validation workflow.

## Installation

### HACS

1. Add this repository as a **Dashboard** custom repository in HACS.
2. Install **Freezer Management Card**.
3. Refresh your browser cache.
4. Add the card as `type: custom:freezer-management-card`.

### Manual installation

1. Copy the two files from `dist/` into your Home Assistant `www/` folder.
2. Add the resource:

```yaml
resources:
  - url: /local/freezer-management-card.js
    type: module
```

## Card configuration

### YAML example

```yaml
type: custom:freezer-management-card
title: Fryser
contents_notify: notify.freezer_contents
contents_sensor: sensor.freezer_contents
sort_by: compartment
contents_header: Indhold
compartment_header: Rum
date_header: Dato
show_shortcuts: true
shortcuts:
  - Bolognese
  - Grøntsagssuppe
  - Lasagne
```

### Configuration options

| Option | Required | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `contents_notify` | Yes | The `notify` entity used for persistence, for example `notify.freezer_contents`. |
| `contents_sensor` | Yes | The sensor that exposes the JSON payload through its `items` attribute. |
| `title` | No | Card title. |
| `sort_by` | No | `compartment`, `newest`, `oldest`, or `contents`. Defaults to `compartment`. |
| `contents_header` | No | Override the first table header. |
| `compartment_header` | No | Override the second table header. |
| `date_header` | No | Override the date table header. |
| `show_shortcuts` | No | Show or hide shortcut buttons. Defaults to `true`. |
| `shortcuts` | No | List of preset contents values. |

## Backend setup

This card still uses a lightweight file-backed pattern, but it is updated for Home Assistant's modern notify model:

- Create a **File** integration entry in **Settings → Devices & services**.
- Add a **notification** target that writes to `/config/freezer-contents.json`.
- Use the resulting notify entity as `contents_notify`.
- Add `/config` or a narrower directory to `allowlist_external_dirs`.
- Keep a sensor that reads the last line of that JSON file so the card can load the inventory.

### Example backend YAML

```yaml
homeassistant:
  allowlist_external_dirs:
    - /config

sensor:
  - platform: command_line
    name: freezer_contents
    json_attributes:
      - count
      - items
    command: "tail -1 /config/freezer-contents.json"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.count }}"
```

### Example service test

This is the modern notify pattern the card now uses internally:

```yaml
action: notify.send_message
data:
  entity_id: notify.freezer_contents
  message: '{"count":0,"items":[]}'
```

## Notes about the data model

New writes use this simplified item shape:

```json
{
  "count": 2,
  "items": [
    {
      "contents": "Bolognese",
      "compartment": "2",
      "date": "30 Apr 2026",
      "iso_date": "2026-04-30T12:34:56.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

The card still reads older `potContents` / `potCompartment` data if it finds it, but all new saves use the simplified model.

## Dashboard editor support

The card now exposes a graphical editor through `getConfigElement()` and a starter configuration through `getStubConfig()`.

## Release and validation workflows

- `.github/workflows/validate.yml` runs the HACS validator using the `plugin` category.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` creates a GitHub release when you push a version tag like `v0.4.0`.

## Future improvements

### Architecture

- Replace the file + sensor persistence chain with a tiny custom integration that stores data with Home Assistant storage helpers instead of serializing JSON through a notify entity.
- Expose services like `freezer_management.add_item`, `freezer_management.remove_item`, and a storage-backed summary entity.
- Add diagnostics or a health sensor so the UI can show stale or unreadable storage cleanly.

### Frontend

- Rewrite the card in Lit + TypeScript for better rendering, state handling, and editor maintainability.
- Add filter/search controls and optional compartment grouping.
- Add import/export actions for freezer inventories.
- Add optimistic updates with rollback when persistence fails.
- Add optional quantity, tags, or expiry metadata as a deliberate second-generation schema instead of reintroducing the old container layer.

## Development notes

- The card disables edits while the backing sensor is unavailable to avoid overwriting unknown state.
- `dist/freezer-management-card.js` is the file HACS should serve.
- `hacs.json` is configured for a Dashboard/plugin repository.


## Troubleshooting note

If you saw `async_register_platform_entity_service() takes 3 positional arguments but 6 were given`, update to version 1.0.2 or later. That issue was caused by using an outdated positional-call pattern against the current Home Assistant entity service registration API.
